Each team members details was stored in a nested dictionary with a unique key (a, b, c, d, e) so that we can access their details easily. Next, f-strings was used to format the output in a structured way so that it's easier to read and understand.
Each team member's details will be printed on a separate line and for the numbering, a number was included in the f-string before 'Name' and the rest of the details aligned to the right.
The final print statement will print out a header with the name of the team concatenated (+) with all team members details in order
